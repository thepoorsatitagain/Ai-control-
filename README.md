TITLE: AUTHENTICATED AI CONTROL PLANE WITH VERSION-CONTROLLED 
CONTENT AND ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE 
INVENTOR: Robert , Kalamazoo, MI 49007, USA 
ABSTRACT 
This invention provides an Authenticated AI Control Plane that governs interactions between 
users and generative AI models. The system integrates version-controlled content retrieval, 
adaptive safety governance, persona persistence, and deterministic replay capabilities into a 
unified middleware architecture. User interactions begin with an Authentication Gateway that 
validates identity, access tier, safety constraints, and permissible content versions. A Version
Controlled Knowledge Base (VCKB) supplies author-governed authoritative material, 
effectively suppressing model hallucinations. Safety is enforced through a Governance 
Enforcement Module (GEM), utilizing delegated guardrails and liability-handshake protocols. A 
Deterministic Replay Engine captures inference parameters to enable exact session regeneration 
for auditing. The architecture functions as a model-agnostic control layer, ensuring that any 
connected AI engine adheres to strict version constraints and safety rules. 
I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
The invention concerns artificial intelligence systems, specifically an authenticated control plane 
designed for governed, version-controlled, and adaptive AI interaction across diverse domains 
such as education, technical training, therapy, creative development, and clinical support. This 
invention relates to governance, traceability, and controlled execution of generative AI systems. 
II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), have expanded 
rapidly into applications such as education, coaching, therapeutic guidance, technical support, 
and creative assistance. Despite these advances, current AI systems remain unsuitable for 
authoritative or high-stakes instruction due to several limitations. 
First, existing AI systems lack mechanisms for enforcing the use of authoritative, version
controlled instructional content. Traditional LLM outputs are influenced by internal weights and 
training data, making it difficult to guarantee fidelity to approved instructional materials. 
Second, current AI systems do not maintain persistent instructional personas. Human learners 
benefit from consistent instructors who understand their long-term progress, emotional profile, 
strengths, and weaknesses. 
Third, AI systems lack robust, configurable safety governance required for specialized domains 
such as clinical therapy, trauma processing, or hazardous engineering instruction. Generic 
guardrails are insufficient and cannot be adjusted by qualified supervisors or domain experts. 
Fourth, AI-generated visual materials such as diagrams or schematics may be inaccurate or 
fabricated, posing safety risks. Current AI models lack a mechanism to verify generated visuals 
against authoritative references. 
Fifth, AI systems generally cannot reproduce prior outputs deterministically. Because they 
incorporate stochastic sampling, identical re-generation of an explanation for auditing is typically 
impossible. 
Sixth, current AI systems do not provide content authors with effective mechanisms to protect 
intellectual property rights or receive compensation when their materials are used for AI
powered instruction. Existing platforms lack granular access control or usage logging preventing 
domain experts from fairly monetizing their contributions. 
III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
The present invention provides a unified Authenticated AI Control Plane that enables 
authoritative, version-controlled guidance across educational, technical, creative, therapeutic, 
and clinical domains. The system improves AI reliability by enforcing deterministic, traceable, 
and policy-governed inference behavior. 
Through the use of an authentication key, the system establishes user identity, permissions, 
safety requirements, and interaction permissions before any interaction begins. Instructional 
content is sourced not from the AI model's latent space but from externally hosted, version
controlled, author-governed repositories (VCKB). The system retrieves and prioritizes these 
materials during inference, preventing hallucinations and guaranteeing fidelity to approved 
content. 
A suite of adaptive components further enhances the instructional experience. The Persona 
Persistence Engine maintains long-term continuity by modeling user preferences and tone 
sensitivity. The Cognitive Load Adaptation Module modulates complexity in real time based on 
user responses. 
Safety governance is implemented through a Governance Enforcement Module, specifically 
utilizing a Guardrail Delegation System, enabling qualified supervisors to override default safety 
rules and authorize specialized instruction. High-risk topics require completion of a Liability 
Handshake Protocol that establishes shared responsibility. 
To address the problem of inaccurate visuals, the Visual Asset Verification System cross-checks 
all generated diagrams against an Authoritative Asset Library. The Deterministic Replay Engine 
captures session parameters allowing exact reproduction of past outputs for auditing. 
In some embodiments, the system includes a Market-Control Enforcement Architecture that links 
instructional access to a Monetization Module. This architecture enforces licensing through 
cryptographically signed authentication keys, ties permissible content versions to purchase 
transactions, and blocks unauthorized engines from generating instruction using author
controlled materials . 
In autonomous robotics and physical agent embodiments, the system functions as a hard-coded 
governance nexus. The Execution Envelope Generator constrains physical actuation by 
validating locally generated goals against a cryptographically signed Mission Protocol. This 
prevents the emergence of hallucinated or unauthorized autonomous behaviors in drones, 
industrial robotics, and distributed swarms.

V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
System Architecture Walkthrough The architecture integrates multiple coordinated 
components to deliver authenticated, version-controlled, adaptive, and verifiable AI-assisted 
instruction. At the highest level, the architecture consists of the User Interface Layer (UIL), 
Authenticated Instruction Gateway (AIG), Authoritative Host Service (AHS), Version
Controlled Knowledge Base (VCKB), Persona Persistence Engine (PPE), Cognitive Load 
Adaptation Module (CLAM), Guardrail Delegation System (GDS), Visual Asset Verification 
System (VAVS), Deterministic Replay Engine (DRE), and the generative AI model. 
Technical Improvements to Computer Functionality The disclosed invention provides 
specific and concrete improvements to the functioning of computer systems and machine
learning inference engines. It modifies the operation of the computer itself, introduces new data 
structures, establishes novel execution pathways, and provides deterministic and 
cryptographically enforced control over inherently stochastic neural networks. 
1. Conversion of Stochastic Neural Networks into Deterministic State Machines The 
invention introduces a Deterministic Replay Engine (DRE) that captures the cryptographically 
secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) seed, the active configuration of the 
VCKB, the persona vector state, the retrieval-frame hash, and inference-time configuration 
parameters. By preserving these machine states, the invention transforms a non-deterministic 
neural network into a deterministic computational device capable of byte-for-byte 
reproducibility. 
2. Computational Efficiency Through Slot-In Architecture The invention's Slot-In Inference 
Architecture separates the static inference engine (the LLM) from the mutable, version
controlled knowledge state (VCKB). This separation enables instantaneous knowledge updates 
through low-cost database writes rather than multi-hour gradient-based fine-tuning cycles. 
3. Cryptographically Enforced Execution Gates The invention introduces a Guardrail 
Delegation System (GDS) utilizing asymmetric key pairs, digital signatures, authority packets, 
and cryptographically locked inference channels. Unlike semantic filters, the GDS enforces 
safety and access rules at the cryptographic verification layer. 
Subsystem Descriptions 
• Governance Enforcement Module (GEM): In various embodiments, the system 
comprises a Governance Enforcement Module. As described herein, the Guardrail 
Delegation System (GDS) serves as a specific embodiment of the Governance 
Enforcement Module. The Governance Enforcement Module is the functional component 
responsible for applying the safety policies, resolving protocol overrides, and enforcing 
the cryptographic liability constraints described below. Wherever this specification refers 
to the GDS or Guardrail Delegation System, it is understood to represent the claimed 
Governance Enforcement Module . 
• Cognitive Load Adaptation Module (CLAM): Dynamically modulates instructional 
complexity based on the user's behavioral signals, performance metrics, and emotional 
cues. 
• Deterministic Replay Engine (DRE): Captures all variables needed to recreate an 
identical response, including model seeds and retrieval versions. 
• Multi-Track Instruction Hosting (MTIH): Enables authors to publish multiple 
knowledge domains that can be fused dynamically during instruction. 
• Guardrail Delegation System (GDS): Allows external authorities to override default AI 
safety policies for legitimate purposes, logged cryptographically for transparency. 
• Age Verification Gateway (AVG): Ensures that age-restricted or adult-oriented content 
is not accessible to minors. 
• Dynamic Content Supplementation: As illustrated in FIG. 11, the system proactively 
notifies the user of content gaps when VCKB retrieval confidence falls below a threshold 
and requests explicit permission before accessing external information sources. 
LLM Slot-In Architecture As illustrated in FIG. 12, in some embodiments, the generative AI 
model functions as a replaceable inference engine. The Authenticated Instruction Gateway (AIG) 
and Validation Layer collectively function as an execution envelope generator, producing a non
bypassable set of constraints (the "envelope") that surrounds the model's inference process. 
Before the model generates any text, the system prepares a structured payload that includes: (1) 
authoritative content; (2) the user's active Persona Vector; (3) the applicable safety rules; and (4) 
deterministic replay parameters . 
Autonomous Robotics Governance (FIG. 13) FIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment of a 
governance-controlled autonomous robotic platform. In this embodiment, a Mission Protocol is 
generated by an authenticated content author and stored in the Version-Controlled Knowledge 
Base (VCKB). The Execution Envelope Generator constructs a permitted-action boundary for 
the robotic agent based on the protocol, safety constraints, operational limits, and regulatory 
rules. 
The robot’s edge node includes a local Governance Enforcement Module (GEM), implemented 
in certain embodiments as the Guardrail Delegation System (GDS). The GDS evaluates any 
proposed action generated by the onboard inference model against (1) the Execution Envelope, 
(2) the cryptographically signed Mission Protocol, and (3) the validated state retrieved from the 
VCKB. 
If an action falls outside the allowed operational space—such as navigating away from the work 
area, changing tasks, or generating an unapproved autonomous objective—the GEM intercepts 
and suppresses the action before motor control is actuated. This ensures that hallucinated or 
emergent autonomous behavior cannot cause physical deviation from the assigned mission, even 
in the event of degraded communications or network loss. 
VI. MODEL-AGNOSTIC ARCHITECTURE AND VALIDATION 
In certain embodiments, the system may operate with any transformer-based large language 
model (LLM) provided by an external vendor. The AI Model Validation Layer (MAVL) 
enforces that any generative engine complies with the governed instruction pipeline. 
VII. ADDITIONAL EMBODIMENTS AND USE CASES 
Healthcare Compliance: In some embodiments, the system operates within medical or clinical 
environments where all instructional outputs are constrained to HIPAA-approved content 
versions stored within the Version-Controlled Knowledge Base (VCKB). The Deterministic 
Replay Engine enables byte-accurate regeneration of medical recommendations or educational 
outputs for auditing, malpractice review, or regulatory certification. 
Education Accreditation: In certain instructional contexts, the Deterministic Replay Engine 
ensures that accredited educational modules produce identical outputs for standardized testing or 
certification programs. This embodiment prevents drift in AI-assisted instruction and ensures 
accreditation bodies can replay and verify the exact instructional pathway delivered to a student. 
Financial Auditing: In financial services embodiments, the Governance Enforcement Module 
enforces SEC, FINRA, or equivalent regulatory rules to ensure that model outputs comply with 
legally mandated disclosure constraints. The Deterministic Replay Engine provides an 
immutable audit trail of the AI’s reasoning steps, enabling regulators or auditors to validate the 
compliance of each generated explanation or transaction-support narrative. 
Industrial Safety: In an industrial embodiment, the Execution Envelope Generator is used to 
define permitted action spaces for autonomous or semi-autonomous equipment, such as robotic 
arms or automated manufacturing platforms. Unauthorized robotic movements or hallucinated 
commands—such as self-navigating or deviating from task parameters—are suppressed at the 
edge node by the Governance Enforcement Module. 
Collaborative AI Systems: In some embodiments, multiple AI models operate under a unified 
governance envelope as described in Claim 32. The Governance Enforcement Module 
mediates harmonization between heterogeneous models, ensuring that multi-model systems 
generate outputs that comply with shared safety, policy, and regulatory constraints. 
Regulatory Sandboxing: Multi-tenant or multi-organization deployments may utilize isolated 
execution sandboxes, where each tenant’s governance profile, policy rules, and VCKB versions 
are segregated. The Governance Enforcement Module of Claim 38 ensures that policy 
violations, unsafe instructions, or cross-tenant knowledge leakage are prevented by enforcing 
cryptographically signed governance profiles within each sandbox. 
General Variations: The invention may be deployed in offline or air-gapped environments. 
Prophetic Embodiment A (Neural Interface): In embodiments utilizing Brain-Computer 
Interfaces (BCI), the Authenticated Instruction Gateway (AIG) validates user identity via unique 
biometric neural frequency signatures. 
Prophetic Embodiment B (Autonomous Swarm Governance): In embodiments involving 
drone swarms, the invention serves as a centralized governance nexus. A single Authentication 
Key authorizes a fleet of autonomous agents . 
These embodiments are illustrative and not limiting; any domain requiring deterministic, 
governed, or version-controlled AI behavior falls within the scope of this invention.
